            Why Homework is Basically DLC for School
          </h1>

          Homework - the bane of every student's existence. But have you ever thought about it as the DLC (Downloadable
          Content) of the school experience? Let's dive into why homework is essentially the extra content you have to pay
          for (with your time and sanity) to get the full school experience.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Base Game</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              School is the base game - the core experience you sign up for. Attending classes, taking notes, and
              participating in discussions are all part of the base package. But just like a video game, the real
              challenge lies in the extra content.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The DLC (Homework)</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              Homework is the DLC that you have to purchase (with your time and effort) to get the full school experience.
              It's the extra content that takes the base game to the next level, challenging you to apply what you've
              learned and go beyond the classroom.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Grind</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              Just like in a video game, the homework grind can be real. You have to put in the time and effort to
              complete assignments, study, and prepare for tests. It's the equivalent of grinding levels or collecting
              resources to unlock the next stage of the game.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Microtransactions</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              Tutoring, extra credit, and other academic support services can be seen as the microtransactions of the
              school experience. They're optional, but they can give you an edge and help you progress faster through the
              content.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Endgame</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              Passing your classes and earning your degree is the endgame of the school experience. It's the ultimate goal
              that you've been working towards, unlocking the final achievements and rewards. But to get there, you have
              to navigate the DLC (homework) and grind your way through the challenges.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Glitches and Bugs</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              Let's not forget about the glitches and bugs in the school experience - the unexpected challenges, the
              confusing instructions, and the frustrating technical issues. Just like in a video game, you have to learn
              to adapt and find workarounds to overcome these obstacles.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Community</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              The school community, with its teachers, peers, and support systems, is like the online community of a video
              game. It's where you can find help, advice, and camaraderie as you navigate the challenges of the school
              experience.
            </div>
          </li>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Achievements</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-md p-4 text-gray-300">
              Passing exams, completing projects, and earning good grades are the achievements you unlock throughout your
              school journey. They serve as a sense of accomplishment and progress, just like the achievements in a video
              game.
